# Daily Report Bot

A political tracking bot built to monitor California State Assembly campaigns.  
This project generates daily reports covering:

- FPPC filings
- Press mentions
- Independent expenditures (IEs)

Note: This repo omits one Python file and excludes the `/ie/`, `/data/`, and `/output/` folders. Core logic is intact.

# Planned Updates

- Add a section to track new **Form 410** filings to identify newly declared candidates in target districts.
- Enhance the **FPPC tracker** to calculate a total dollar amount of late contributions, similar to how the IE section displays cumulative spending, also to show who the contributor is.
- Cache Fix on IE Tracker
- Democrat Party Spending Tracker
- Add a Formatter for Staff to receive individual updates
